# Dockerfile Build Error: Missing or Incorrect File Path

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: issues with the `COPY` instruction, specifically when the specified file or directory doesn't exist or is in the wrong location within the build context.

## The Problem

The original `Dockerfile` attempts to copy a `requirements.txt` file and application code, but may fail if either file is missing or improperly located.

## The Solution

The `Dockerfile_fixed` demonstrates the corrected version: Ensuring the `requirements.txt` file exists in the same directory as the Dockerfile and correctly referencing the application files.
